# Android Renderscript Samples

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects:
- [RenderScriptMigrationSample](./RenderScriptMigrationSample): A sample that demonstrates how to migrate RenderScript to Vulkan.
- [BasicRenderScript](./BasicRenderScript): A legacy sample that demonstrates how to use RenderScript to perform some basic image processing.
- [RenderScriptIntrinsic](./RenderScriptIntrinsic): A legacy sample that demonstrates how to use RenderScript intrinsics.

## Renderscript Support Status
